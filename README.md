# Nand2Tetris
This is my take on the nand 2 tetris course (https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
It passes all the included tests in the appropriate course/project.
Feel free to suggest improvements and/or optimizations

TODO List:
-Add Makefiles for the different programs.
-Add the implementation of the compiler and os (the last projects)
